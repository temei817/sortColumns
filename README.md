This lab takes in an arraylist and checks to see if columns are in order. If not, it would return an array with the index of the column that needs to be deleted. 
If the strings in the arraylist are not equal in length, it would return an array with -1 in it. If the columns are in order and the strings are equal in length, it would return an empty array.
