This lab takes in an arraylist and checks to see if columns are in order. If not, it would return an array with the index of the column that needs to be deleted. 
If the strings in the arraylist are not equal in length, it would return an array with -1 in it. If the columns are in order and the strings are equal in length, it would return an empty array. 
The run time of the program is O(n^2) because there is a nested for loop and each for loop is O(n). 
Since it is nested you mulitple the n's. 
The if statements and the declarations are constant.
The space complexity of my implementation is O(n). The arraylist requires O(n) while other variables declared required constant space.
